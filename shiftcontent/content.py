# todo: meta must be an object to be inheritable (do we need inheritance)
# todo: is content item an object as well?
# todo: if we are dealing with objects are we going full-orm?
# todo: is it a good idea to put custom meta fields into schema?
# todo: if we do that, can we go without ORM? <- that'd be perfect

# todo: on the other hand orm is great because w e can do migrations!
# todo: orm is also makes graphql easier (but does it?)
